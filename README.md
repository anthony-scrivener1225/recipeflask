THIS IS A RECIPE PROJECT TO TEST FLASK


** UPDATE THIS PROJECT IS NOW ARCHIVED **

The project hit a point where introducing Javascript was going to change how the front end was being managed. Currently recipes and tags can be added. 

Recipe views based on ID and Login requirements are set for users to make changes. Users have the ability to upload profile photos, change passwords, and update bio. Confirmation emails are set for any email changes or registration. 

Project will be converted into a REST API system using FLASK SMOREST as a backend to frontend project. at anthony-scrivener1224/restapi
